    "content": "\nI’ve been exploring options for setting up a soft router mini PC to run OPNsense, but the most affordable dedicated device I found was around $120 USD. To cut costs, I decided to experiment with Proxmox, allowing me to virtualize OPNsense on an older computer I already had. The machine is about ten years old and can’t run Windows 11, but that actually makes it perfect for this project—and a good opportunity to see what else I can host through Proxmox.\n\nTo handle networking, I ordered a Dell THGMP Intel I350-T4 4-Port 1Gbps Ethernet card, which I plan to pass through directly to the OPNsense virtual machine. This NIC will serve as the main interface for connecting other devices. I found it on eBay for $41 USD, a solid price considering it uses an Intel chipset known for good compatibility with OPNsense.\n\nSince I also want Wi-Fi access for devices like the ESP32 or other hardware without Ethernet ports, I picked up a TP-Link AX1800 Wi-Fi 6 access point. It should be future-proof enough for now, and at $31 USD, it was a good deal. The access point will be limited by the 1Gbps NIC, but I can always upgrade later if it becomes a bottleneck.\n\nAll the hardware has been ordered and is on the way. My next update will cover the setup process and performance results. I also plan to configure a second desktop on the same network once the internet connection is stable. After that, I’ll set up port forwarding on my homelab so I can securely access everything remotely via WireGuard."

    "content": "\nI’ve set up Proxmox on my spare computer and now have OPNsense running through it. I’ll be pausing work on OPNsense for now, since I still need to configure the LAN ports so they work with my access point. In the meantime, I’m going to focus on building out my guides section before my next update. I have a lot of different things I want to experiment with, and I plan to keep working on ricing my MacBook for the rest of this week.\n\nI downloaded Asahi Linux Fedora Remix and installed Hyperland. I’m currently setting everything up and will include screenshots in my guides section. I’ll also share my dotfiles for Hyperland, Waybar, Kitty, and Hyperpaper, along with the JSON config for Fastfetch, since they switched from .conf to .json for configuration.\n\nI’m happy with the middle and right pills on my Waybar, but I still need to fix how the left pill for workspaces looks. I also need to make sure my speakers don’t reset to 100% volume after a restart. I want Workspace 1 to show Fastfetch and other terminal-based processes, and Workspace 5 to serve as my communications workspace, with Thunderbird and KDE Connect.\n\nSo far, I’ve spent around 20 hours ricing my MacBook and about 5 hours setting up Proxmox. The main challenge with customizing my setup is that there are so many small details to adjust. None of them are particularly hard—there’s just a lot to configure.\n\nI’ve also been thinking about building my own watch using an e-ink display and an ESP32. I’m still working out the details, but I want it to display the time and function as a TENS unit for an alarm. I’ll need to figure out the parts and configuration, but I already have an Arduino kit to start experimenting with. Once I’m comfortable, I’ll look into ordering more components.\n\nI’m considering using an Apple Watch battery and keeping the size around 42mm, then 3D printing a custom case. Eventually, I’d like to create a metal version through PCBWay or another manufacturer. I’ll also need to learn some CAD to model the case properly. It’s definitely a long-term project, but one I’m excited to start.\n"
