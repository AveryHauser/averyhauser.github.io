I’ve set up Proxmox on my spare computer and now have OPNsense running through it. I’ll be pausing work on OPNsense for now, since I still need to configure the LAN ports so they work with my access point. In the meantime, I’m going to focus on building out my guides section before my next update. I have a lot of different things I want to experiment with, and I plan to keep working on ricing my MacBook for the rest of this week.

I downloaded Asahi Linux Fedora Remix and installed Hyperland. I’m currently setting everything up and will include screenshots in my guides section. I’ll also share my dotfiles for Hyperland, Waybar, Kitty, and Hyperpaper, along with the JSON config for Fastfetch, since they switched from .conf to .json for configuration.

I’m happy with the middle and right pills on my Waybar, but I still need to fix how the left pill for workspaces looks. I also need to make sure my speakers don’t reset to 100% volume after a restart. I want Workspace 1 to show Fastfetch and other terminal-based processes, and Workspace 5 to serve as my communications workspace, with Thunderbird and KDE Connect.

So far, I’ve spent around 20 hours ricing my MacBook and about 5 hours setting up Proxmox. The main challenge with customizing my setup is that there are so many small details to adjust. None of them are particularly hard—there’s just a lot to configure.

I’ve also been thinking about building my own watch using an e-ink display and an ESP32. I’m still working out the details, but I want it to display the time and function as a TENS unit for an alarm. I’ll need to figure out the parts and configuration, but I already have an Arduino kit to start experimenting with. Once I’m comfortable, I’ll look into ordering more components.

I’m considering using an Apple Watch battery and keeping the size around 42mm, then 3D printing a custom case. Eventually, I’d like to create a metal version through PCBWay or another manufacturer. I’ll also need to learn some CAD to model the case properly. It’s definitely a long-term project, but one I’m excited to start.
