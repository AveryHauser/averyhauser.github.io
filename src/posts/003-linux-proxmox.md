I have been running fedora remix through asahi for the last week or two. I got most of my customizations finished. However I am using the same amount of resources that I would have been on macos. I found an auction online for a thinkpad t470s for 16.50 plus shipping and tax. I ended up getting the laptop and it is not coming until next Monday. After running linux on my mac I found that it is nice but not something that I would like to do long term. It would be a lot easier on x86 and a thinkpad.

I was planning on getting the t480 but I wanted to get a cheap laptop that I would not have a risk in case it does not work. I found the t470s which the only bummer is that it has a dual core processor. However I want to run Arch lts headless then install xorg and dwm. This should allow me to have a laptop that uses minimal resources. Since my goal is to run minimal resources I also can use an older laptop. It is non functioning but I should be able to get it working. If not then I can sell the working screen and ram. The ram would pay for itself with the huge spike in ram prices. If I am able to get everything working on the t470s then I will switch to that being my daily driver. I am trying to be more minimal with my computing devices and save some of the older technology that is going out from the windows 11 requirements.

I will finish setting up my access point for proxmox next week when my new laptop comes in. I need to connect to the ethernet so that I can configure the access point. I figured I can either use an ethernet to usb adapter and borrow it from a friend. I would then have to plug this into my dock since I use a macbook air. This seems to be getting a little out of hand. Since my t470s will have an ethernet port I am going to wait until that comes in next Monday.

With classes and finals being in 3 weeks I am going to be studying a lot more. I will not have a lot of time for the side projects. I will also update the guides section this week. I also need to update the projects that I am currently working on. I also need to apply for more internships. So I will be doing a lot this week and in the upcoming weeks. I also might add a cert section on my upcoming project section. It is also really slow and takes a while for it to load. So I might look into that as well.

Once I get proxmox working then I will start drawing up my homelab diagram. I will use draw.io since it seems like a good tool for this. I also need to build another computer since christmas is coming up soon and that is for someone.
